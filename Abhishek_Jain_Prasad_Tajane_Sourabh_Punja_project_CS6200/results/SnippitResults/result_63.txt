In particular, several parallelized 
algorithms are presented for the solution of certain
spanning tree, distance, and path problems, with 
direct applications to wire routing, PERT chart analysis,
and the analysis of many types of networks.

Several families of numerical procedures
which use the technique of the procedures in 
a <b><b>parallel</b></b> processing environment are developed and measurements
of these statistics are reported.

A
program for the determination of the distribution 
of current in an electrical network was written for a
<b><b>parallel</b></b>-processor computing system, and execution 
of this program was simulated.

It is shown that 
different algorithms suggested in the literature vary significantly
in execution time and that the B-schedule 
of Coffman and Graham is near-optimal.

On the Time Required for a Sequence of Matrix Products

This paper discusses the multiplication of conformable
sequences of row vectors, column vectors, 
and square matrices.





Document number:2195
Rank:7
The method described is suitable for <b><b>parallel</b></b> 
processing because the operations relative to each
state can be computed in <b><b>parallel</b></b>, and the number
of stages is equal to the length N of the curves (or
to log2 N if the approximate method is used).
