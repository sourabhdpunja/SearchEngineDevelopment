Usually, sharing is accomplished by allowing
several users to share data via input and output 
of information stored in files kept in secondary storage.

DAD, The C. Operating System

The design and implementation of the C.
<b>operating</b> system, DAD, is described in detail.

The algorithm is described as being practical 
 because it is not optimal according to metrics developed
for its analysis in this paper, and also because 
it can be implemented in existing networks with less complexity
than that required for the known alternatives.

The relationship of the mechanism
to protection mechanisms in the system is explained; in particular,
eventcounts are shown to be applicable to situations where confinement
of information matters.

The abstract model provides
a framework for implementing flexible schedulers 
in real <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b>.

Reflections on an Operating System Design

The main features of a general purpose multiaccess
<b>operating</b> system developed for the CDC 6400 
at Berkeley are presented, and its good and bad points are
discussed as they appear in retrospect.

The model is used to explain 
security features of several existing <b>systems</b>, and serves
as a framework for a proposal for general security 
system implementation within today's languages and <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b>.
