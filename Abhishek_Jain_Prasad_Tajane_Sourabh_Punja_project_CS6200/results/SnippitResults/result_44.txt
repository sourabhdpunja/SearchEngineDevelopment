On Computing Sets of Shortest Paths in a Graph

Two algorithms are presented that construct
the k shortest paths between every pair of vertices 
in a directed graph.

Among
these are the need for a notation for iterating 
over the elements of any finite set (instead of the
more narrow for i:= 1 to n notation), the use of 
the domain of an array as a data type, the need for
a simple notation for allowing types of parameters 
to be themselves parameters (but in a restrictive fashion),
and resulting problems with conversion of 
values from one type to another.

Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System

The concept of one event happening before
another in a distributed system is examined, and
is shown to define a partial ordering of the events.

Complexity of Computations

The framework for research in the theory of complexity
of computations is described, emphasizing 
the in terrelation between seemingly diverse problems
and methods.

Rank:10
Examples are given involving array languages
consisting of simple geometrical patterns, as 
well as a language of "neuron pictures."
