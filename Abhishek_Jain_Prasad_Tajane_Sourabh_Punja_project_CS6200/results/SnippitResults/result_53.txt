For example, the adjacency
matrix of a graph is easily mapped onto an array; 
each matrix element is stored in one cell of the array,
and typical row and column operations are readily 
implemented by simple cell logic.

Some Ideas on Data Types in High-Level Languages

A number of issues are explored concerning the
notion that a data type is a set of values together 
with a set of primitive operations on those values.

Based on primitive notions of module, message,
and transaction key, the methodology is shown to be independent
of particular languages and machines.

Prime design goals of the design are the
ability to produce highly efficient object code, 
to allow access to all relevant hardware features of
the host machine, and to provide a rational means 
by which to cope with the evolutionary nature of systems
programs.
