The ordered sequence of contour points and the connection graph of
the <b><b><b>image</b></b></b> are first obtained by a modified Ledley algorithm in one
<b><b><b>image</b></b></b> scan.

Extensions to the theory of computation 
and computability are suggested.

The main results obtained 
are a clear and useful separation of structural and behavioral
model description, a reduction of manual 
tasks in converting Boolean logic into a structural model,
the elimination of manual processes in achieving 
exclusive simulation of activity, an event-scheduling
technique which does not deteriorate in economy
as the event queue grows in length, and a simulation
procedure which deals effectively with any mixture 
of serial and simultaneous activities.

A Study of Line Overhead in the Arpanet

The form, extent, and effect of the communication line
overhead in the ARPANET are considered.

A
criterion for the implementation efficiency of an 
algorithm is developed and results in the definition
of time-invariant algorithms, which <b>include</b> most 
of the commonly implemented ones.

On the Interface Between Computers and Data Communications Systems

Future systems that combine computers, <b><b>digital</b></b>
terminals, and communications equipment present 
design optimization problems that require reconsideration
of the traditional functional responsibilities 
of the respective subsystems.

The
bases for this organization are a generalized interrupt structure
and the newly introduced concept of "file tagging," which is the
process of associating program structures and interrupt generating
conditions with items in the data base.

It is shown that 
different algorithms suggested in the literature vary significantly
in execution time and that the B-schedule 
of Coffman and Graham is near-optimal.

The analyzed problem statement 
was translated to the form necessary for use by the
SODA (Systems Optimization and Design Algorithm)
program for the generation of alternative specifications
of program modules and logical database structures.

We achieve the required alignment by matching the real
<b><b><b>image</b></b></b> with a synthetic <b><b><b>image</b></b></b> obtained from a surface 
model and known positions of the light sources.
