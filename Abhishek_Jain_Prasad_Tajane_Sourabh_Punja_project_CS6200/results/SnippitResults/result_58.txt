Cellular Arrays for the Solution of Graph Problems

A cellular array is a two-dimensional, checkerboard
type interconnection of identical modules 
(or cells), where each cell contains a few bits of
memory and a small amount of combinational logic, 
and communicates mainly with its immediate neighbors
in the array.

Nonlinear Regression and the Solution of Simultaneous Equations

If one has a set of observables (Z1,...,Zm) which
are bound in a relation with certain parameters 
(A1,...,An) by an equation S(Z1,...;A1,...)=0, one frequently
has the problem of determining a set of 
values of the Ai which minimizes the sum of <b>squares</b> of
differences between observed and calculated values 
of a distinguished observable, say Zm.

The determination
of the type-wise correctness or incorrectness 
of the program is resolved by reducing its corresponding
Lambda calculus expression to one of two normal 
forms, the constant "correct" for a type-wise correct
program or the constant "error".
