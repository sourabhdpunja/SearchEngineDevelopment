For most contexts of the concatenate statement, the <b>code</b>
produced by a compiler using the expansion-<b>optimization</b> 
strategy described above compares favorably with the
<b>code</b> produced by a conventional PL/I optimizing 
compiler.

On Compiling Algorithms for Arithmetic Expressions

This paper deals with algorithms concerning arithmetic
expressions used in a FORTRAN IV compiler 
for a HITAC-5020 computer having n accumulators.

Information is stored
in segments each of which is potentially sharable 
and carries its own independent attributes of size and access
privilege.

The system is defined by
a combination of microprograms and software.

Rank:6
The simplifications are based
on the form of the program and the knowledge obtained 
by a processor, without any understanding of what the
program is supposed to do.

The PDP-10's
contributions to computing technology include: 
accelerating the transition from batch oriented to time
sharing computing systems; transferring hardware 
technology within DEC (and elsewhere) to minicomputer
design and manufacturing; supporting minicomputer 
hardware and software development; and serving as a
model for single user and timeshared interactive 
minicomputer/microcomputer systems.

Levels of Computer Systems

In building current computer systems, we tend
to break them down into "levels" of control, 
command and communication; in using the system, we break
our problems down correspondingly.

Essential objectives sought are improved
ease and economy in model generation, economy 
in execution time and <b>space</b>, and a facility for handling
simultaneous activities.

An implementation of eventcount
s and sequencers in a system with shared memory is described.
