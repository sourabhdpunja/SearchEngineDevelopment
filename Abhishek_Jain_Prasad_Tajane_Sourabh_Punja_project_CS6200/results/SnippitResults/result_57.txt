<b>A</b> major challenge
in the effective use of cellular arrays for the 
solution of graph problems is the determination of algorithms
that exploit the possibilities for parallelism, 
especially for problems whose solutions appear to be inherently
serial.

Among
these are the need for a notation for iterating 
over the elements of any finite set (instead of the
more narrow for i:= 1 to n notation), the use of 
the domain of an array as a data type, the need for
a simple notation for allowing types of parameters 
to be themselves parameters (but in a restrictive fashion),
and resulting problems with conversion of 
values from one type to another.

The
questions of local and global environments and of 
various modes of function calling and parameter passing
are touched upon.

Based on primitive notions of module, message,
and transaction key, the methodology is shown to be independent
of particular languages and machines.

This paper attempts to isolate 
the notion of type checking and presents a partial
solution to the type checking problem based on the 
notions of abstraction and application of functions.

<b>A</b> variety 
of data representations which have been used to describe
structured information are then examined, and 
the characteristics of various processing languages are
outlined in the light of the procedures requiring 
implementation.

<b>A</b> major feature which contributes 
to the realization of these goals is a mechanism permitting
the definition of the representation of all 
data structures in terms of the access algorithm for elements of the structure.

Pictorial 
results produced by each of the algorithms are presented
and the relative performances of the algorithms 
are compared.

Inherent 
defects at the most basic level cause them to be both
fat and weak: their primitive word-at-a-time <b>style</b> 
of <b>programming</b> inherited from their common ancestor-the
von <b>Neumann</b> computer, their close coupling off 
semantics to state transitions, their division of <b>programming</b>
into a world of expressions and a world 
of statements, their inability to effectively use powerful
combining forms for building new programs 
from existing ones, and their lack of useful mathematical
properties for reasoning about programs.

The amount of light coming from a given direction is
modeled in a similar manner to the texture mapping 
and then added to the intensity obtained from the texture
mapping.
