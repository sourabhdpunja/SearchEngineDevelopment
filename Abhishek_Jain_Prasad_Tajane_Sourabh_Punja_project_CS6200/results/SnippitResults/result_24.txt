Applications in Markov renewal programming
and in the construction of variable length 
codes are reviewed, and an updating procedure for dealing
with certain sequences of <b>stochastic</b> matrices 
is discussed.

It is pointed 
out heuristically and demonstrated numerically that
an increase is obtain able in the average execution 
interval of the multiprogrammed load over that resulting
from equal fixed partitioning of main memory.

Interarrival Statistics for Time Sharing Systems

The optimization of time-shared system performance
requires the description of the <b>stochastic</b> 
<b>processes</b> governing the user inputs and the program activity.
