Cellular Arrays for the Solution of Graph Problems

A cellular array is a two-dimensional, checkerboard
type interconnection of identical modules 
(or cells), where each cell contains a few bits of
memory and a small amount of combinational logic, 
and communicates mainly with its immediate neighbors
in the array.

Among
these are the need for a notation for iterating 
over the elements of any finite set (instead of the
more narrow for i:= 1 to n notation), the use of 
the domain of an array as a data type, the need for
a simple notation for allowing types of parameters 
to be themselves parameters (but in a restrictive fashion),
and resulting problems with conversion of 
values from one type to another.

It is found that the algorithm operating
with the triangular array is the most sensitive 
to image irregularities and noise, yet it will yield
a thinned image with an overall reduced number of 
points.

Data Manipulation and Programming Problems
in Automatic Information Retrieval

Automatic information retrieval programs require
the manipulation of a variety of different 
data structures, including linear text, sparse matrices,
and tree or list structures.

This is part of an ambitious
program of development in advanced programming <b>languages</b>, and relations
with other aspects of the project are also discussed.

The determination
of the type-wise correctness or incorrectness 
of the program is resolved by reducing its corresponding
Lambda calculus expression to one of two normal 
forms, the constant "correct" for a type-wise correct
program or the constant "error".

On Computing Sets of Shortest Paths in a Graph

Two algorithms are presented that construct
the k shortest paths between every pair of vertices 
in a directed graph.

A major feature which contributes 
to the realization of these goals is a mechanism permitting
the definition of the representation of all 
data structures in terms of the access algorithm for elements of the structure.

On the Conversion of Programs to Decision Tables: Method and Objectives

The problems of converting programs to decision
tables are investigated.





Document number:2470
Rank:10
The
questions of local and global environments and of 
various modes of function calling and parameter passing
are touched upon.
