Cellular Arrays for the Solution of Graph Problems

A cellular array is a two-dimensional, checkerboard
type interconnection of identical modules 
(or cells), where each cell contains a few bits of
memory and a small amount of combinational logic, 
and communicates mainly with its immediate neighbors
in the array.

These algorithms generalize the Floyd
algorithm and the Dantzig algorithm for finding 
the shortest path between every pair of vertices in a directed graph.

Among
these are the need for a notation for iterating 
over the elements of any finite set (instead of the
more narrow for i:= 1 to n notation), the use of 
the domain of an array as a data type, the need for
a simple notation for allowing types of parameters 
to be themselves parameters (but in a restrictive fashion),
and resulting problems with conversion of 
values from one type to another.

Pictorial 
results produced by each of the algorithms are presented
and the relative performances of the algorithms 
are compared.

A major feature which contributes 
to the realization of these goals is a mechanism permitting
the definition of the representation of all 
data structures in terms of the access algorithm for elements of the structure.

Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System

The concept of one event happening before
another in a <b><b><b>distributed</b></b></b> system is examined, and
is shown to define a partial ordering of the events.

An extension of APL is proposed that
includes new primitive functions to manipulate the nesting
level of arrays and new operators to assist in the
construction of data-driven algorithms.

Complexity of Computations

The framework for research in the <b>theory</b> of complexity
of computations is described, emphasizing 
the in terrelation between seemingly diverse problems
and methods.

A
criterion for the implementation efficiency of an 
algorithm is developed and results in the definition
of time-invariant algorithms, which <b>include</b> most 
of the commonly implemented ones.
