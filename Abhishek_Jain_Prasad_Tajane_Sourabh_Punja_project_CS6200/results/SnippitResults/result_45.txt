In particular, several parallelized 
algorithms are presented for the solution of certain
spanning tree, distance, and path problems, with 
direct applications to wire routing, PERT chart analysis,
and the analysis of many types of networks.

Randomized Binary Search Technique

A mathematical model is developed for the mean
and variance of the number of trials to recover 
a given document in a randomly received list of files.

These algorithms generalize the Floyd
algorithm and the Dantzig algorithm for finding 
the shortest path between every pair of vertices in a directed graph.

Based on primitive notions of module, message,
and transaction key, the methodology is shown to be independent
of particular languages and machines.

Prime design goals of the design are the
ability to produce highly efficient object code, 
to allow access to all relevant hardware features of
the host machine, and to provide a rational means 
by which to cope with the evolutionary nature of systems
programs.

Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System

<b>The</b> concept of one event happening before
another in a <b>distributed</b> <b>system</b> is examined, and
is shown to define a partial ordering of the events.

Complexity of Computations

<b>The</b> framework for <b>research</b> in the theory of complexity
of computations is described, emphasizing 
the in terrelation between seemingly diverse problems
and methods.

An extension of APL is proposed that
<b>includes</b> new primitive functions to manipulate the nesting
level of arrays and new operators to assist in the
construction of data-driven algorithms.
