the shortest path between every pair of vertices in a directed <b><b><b>graph</b></b></b>.

The method described is suitable for parallel 
processing because the operations relative to each
state can be computed in parallel, and the number
of stages is equal to the length N of the curves (or
to log2 N if the approximate method is used).

A
criterion for the implementation efficiency of an 
algorithm is developed and results in the definition
of time-invariant <b><b>algorithms</b></b>, which include most 
of the commonly implemented ones.

New Methods to Color the Vertices of a Graph

This paper describes efficient new <b>heuristic</b>
methods to color the vertices of a <b><b><b>graph</b></b></b> which rely
upon the comparison of the degrees and structure of a <b><b><b>graph</b></b></b>.

The main results obtained 
are a clear and useful separation of structural and behavioral
model description, a reduction of manual 
tasks in converting Boolean logic into a structural model,
the elimination of manual processes in achieving 
exclusive simulation of activity, an event-scheduling
technique which does not deteriorate in economy
as the event queue grows in length, and a simulation
procedure which deals effectively with any mixture 
of serial and simultaneous activities.
