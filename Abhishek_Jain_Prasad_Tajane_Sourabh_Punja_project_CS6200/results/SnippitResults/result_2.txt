Several omissions in his model are noted,
and new assumptions are introduced to overcome 
these omissions.

The system is defined by
a combination of microprograms and software.

Rank:5
The system is not oriented
towards either mode and can be either a batch 
processing system (such as the ATLAS Supervisor, IBSYS,
or GECOS), or a multiaccess system (resembling, 
to the user, CTSS or MULTICS), or both simultaneously,
depending on the installation, which can adjust 
the Schedulers.

The input process 
is assumed to be stationary, and to be defined by the
interarrival time distribution.

No attempt was made to use reentrant code, 
or to simulate segmentation or paging.

The system also
permits simple specification of test and argument 
arrays in single statements.

The program segments called 
into execution by the remote CRT consoles are invariably
run to completion rather than "rolled-out" to 
be brought back at a later time.

Influences external to the systems, such as
the sequence of problem solution, and programmer 
and problem characteristics, were specified as design
factors in the experiment.
