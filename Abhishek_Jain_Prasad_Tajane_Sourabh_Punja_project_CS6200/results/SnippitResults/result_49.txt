Floating-Point Arithmetic with 84-Bit Numbers

A classic and straightforward technique is
presented which is not limited to the size or type 
of number representation used or multiple precision arithmetic.

<b>The</b> 
model encompasses several diverse classes of linguistic
<b>knowledge</b>, which include: (1) executable tests 
of conceptual properties stored in discrimination nets;
(2) <b>information</b> relating conceptual to syntactic 
roles, stored in a word-sense dictionary, and (3) surface
grammatical <b>knowledge</b>, stored in a formal grammar.

Among
these are the need for a notation for iterating 
over the elements of any finite set (instead of the
more narrow for i:= 1 to n notation), the use of 
the domain of an array as a data type, the need for
a simple notation for allowing types of parameters 
to be themselves parameters (but in a restrictive fashion),
and resulting problems with conversion of 
values from one type to another.

This is part of an ambitious
program of development in advanced programming languages, and relations
with other aspects of the project are also discussed.

A major feature which contributes 
to the realization of these goals is a mechanism permitting
the definition of the representation of all 
data structures in terms of the access algorithm for elements of the structure.

Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System

<b>The</b> concept of one event happening before
another in a distributed system is examined, and
is shown to define a partial ordering of the events.

Advantages of these programming languages
for the <b>retrieval</b> application are examined, 
and suggestions are made for the design of programming
facilities to aid in <b>information</b> <b>retrieval</b>.

Complexity of Computations

<b>The</b> framework for research in the theory of complexity
of computations is described, emphasizing 
the in terrelation between seemingly diverse problems
and methods.
