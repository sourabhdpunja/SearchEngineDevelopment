In particular, several parallelized 
<b>algorithms</b> are presented for the solution of certain
spanning tree, distance, and path problems, with 
direct applications to wire routing, PERT chart analysis,
and the analysis of many types of networks.

Pictorial 
results produced by each of the <b>algorithms</b> are presented
and the relative performances of the <b>algorithms</b> 
are compared.

These <b>algorithms</b> generalize the Floyd
algorithm and the Dantzig algorithm for finding 
the shortest path between every pair of vertices in a directed graph.

Among
these are the need for a notation for iterating 
over the elements of any finite set (instead of the
more narrow for i:= 1 to n notation), the use of 
the domain of an array as a data type, the need for
a simple notation for allowing types of parameters 
to be themselves parameters (but in a restrictive fashion),
and resulting problems with conversion of 
values from one type to another.

Based on primitive notions of module, message,
and transaction key, the methodology is shown to be independent
of particular languages and machines.

Prime design goals of the design are the
ability to produce highly efficient object code, 
to allow access to all relevant hardware features of
the host machine, and to provide a rational means 
by which to cope with the evolutionary nature of systems
programs.

Data Manipulation and Programming Problems
in Automatic Information Retrieval

Automatic information retrieval programs require
the manipulation of a variety of different 
data structures, including linear text, sparse matrices,
and tree or list structures.

Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System

The concept of one event happening before
another in a distributed system is examined, and
is shown to define a partial ordering of the events.

Illustrative examples of practical 
and theoretical significance are given.

An extension of APL is proposed that
includes new primitive functions to manipulate the nesting
level of arrays and new operators to assist in the
construction of data-driven <b>algorithms</b>.
