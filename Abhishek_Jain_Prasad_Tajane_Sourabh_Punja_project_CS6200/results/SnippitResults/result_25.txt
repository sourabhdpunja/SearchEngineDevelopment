System <b>Performance</b> Evaluation: Survey and Appraisal

The state of the art of system performance
<b>evaluation</b> is reviewed and <b>evaluation</b> goals and 
problems are examined.

The effective progress rate of each 
program is sensitive to many detailed characteristics
of itself and its co-residents and simulation has 
been the best available method of predicting it.

Computer-aided 
analysis consists of a set of procedures and <b>computer</b>
programs specifically designed to aid in the process 
of applications software design, <b>computer</b> selection
and performance <b>evaluation</b>.

A Comparison of List Schedules for Parallel Processing Systems

The problem of scheduling two or more processors
to minimize the execution time of a program 
which consists of a set of partially ordered tasks
is studied.





Document number:1892
Rank:5
Implications of the results to time-shared
system design and programming are discussed, 
and a calculation of the optimal degree of multiprogramming
for a wide range of parameters is presented 
graphically.





Document number:2950
Rank:6
A
criterion for the implementation efficiency of an 
algorithm is developed and results in the definition
of time-invariant algorithms, which include most 
of the commonly implemented ones.

An Interrupt Based Organization for Management Information Systems

A programming structure, language constructs, and a supervisory system 
organization are proposed
for the design and coding of large shared data base <b>systems</b>.

A Methodology for Calculating and
Optimizing Real-Time System <b>Performance</b>

The continually increasing size, complexity,
number of types, and cost of data processing <b>systems</b> 
are causing serious re-examination within government
and industry of the criteria for and methods of 
calculating and optimizing data processing system cost
and performance.

Interarrival Statistics for Time Sharing Systems

The optimization of time-shared system performance
requires the description of the stochastic 
processes governing the user inputs and the program activity.
