Advantages of these programming languages
for the retrieval application are examined, 
and suggestions are made for the design of programming
facilities to aid in information retrieval.

In particular, several parallelized 
algorithms are presented for the solution of certain
spanning tree, distance, and path problems, with 
direct applications to wire routing, PERT chart analysis,
and the analysis of many types of networks.

A
program for the determination of the distribution 
of current in an electrical network was written for a
<b>parallel</b>-processor computing system, and execution 
of this program was simulated.

This language
is designed so as to be especially suitable 
for use in writing production software systems for a
specific machine (the PDP-10): compilers, operating 
systems, etc.

Among
these are the need for a notation for iterating 
over the elements of any finite set (instead of the
more narrow for i:= 1 to n notation), the use of 
the domain of an array as a data type, the need for
a simple notation for allowing types of parameters 
to be themselves parameters (but in a restrictive fashion),
and resulting problems with conversion of 
values from one type to another.
