In particular, several parallelized 
algorithms are presented for the solution of certain
spanning tree, distance, and path problems, with 
direct applications to wire routing, PERT chart analysis,
and the analysis of many types of networks.

Data Manipulation and Programming Problems
in Automatic Information Retrieval

Automatic information retrieval programs require
the manipulation of a variety of different 
data structures, including linear text, sparse matrices,
and tree or list structures.

This paper attempts to isolate 
the notion of type checking and presents a partial
solution to the type checking problem based on the 
notions of abstraction and application of functions.

It is described how the local environment can be modeled
as a data item and how imperative statements 
can be considered functions on the environment.

The Treatment of Data Types in <b>EL1</b>

In constructing a general purpose programming
language, a key issue is providing a sufficient 
set of data types and associated operations in a manner
that permits both natural problem-oriented notation 
and efficient implementation.

These criteria
imply that a user can, if he desires, either 
know or control all the influences affecting the content
and extent of his computer's output.

The method described is suitable for parallel 
processing because the operations relative to each
state can be computed in parallel, and the number
of stages is equal to the length N of the curves (or
to log2 N if the approximate method is used).

This language
is designed so as to be especially suitable 
for use in writing production software systems for a
specific machine (the PDP-10): compilers, operating 
systems, etc.

Thinning Algorithms on Rectangular, Hexagonal, and Triangular Arrays

In this report three thinning algorithms are
developed: one each for use with rectangular, 
hexagonal, and triangular arrays.

Based on primitive notions of module, message,
and transaction key, the methodology is shown to be independent
of particular languages and machines.
