Data Manipulation and Programming Problems
in Automatic <b>Information</b> Retrieval

Automatic information <b>retrieval</b> programs require
the manipulation of a variety of different 
data structures, including linear text, sparse matrices,
and tree or list structures.

A major challenge
in the effective use of cellular arrays for the 
solution of graph problems is the determination of algorithms
that exploit the possibilities for parallelism, 
especially for problems whose solutions appear to be inherently
serial.

This feature is used in the <b>retrieval</b>
process by leaving the exact sequence of 
operations initially unspecified, and adapting the
<b>search</b> strategy to the needs of individual users.

The technique is contrasted 
with the use of the paradoxical combinator, Y.

This is part of an ambitious
program of development in advanced programming languages, and relations
with other aspects of the project are also discussed.

The expected gain and its probability
distribution are derived as a function 
of: (1) the prior proportion of omitted terms, and (2) the
coefficient of separation between two distributions 
corresponding to values of an adjustment statistic.

Thus, for example, the structure for <b>retrieval</b> 
on the basis of ranges of values of a given attribute would
be very different from one where only <b>retrieval</b> 
on the basis of a single value is permitted.

Dynamic Document Processing

The current role of computers in automatic
document processing is briefly outlined, and some 
reasons are given why the early promise of library automation
and of the mechanization of documentation 
processes has not been fulfilled.
