It is shown that 
different <b>algorithms</b> suggested in the literature vary significantly
in execution time and that the B-schedule 
of Coffman and Graham is near-optimal.

Finally an exact method is given which performs better
than the Randall-Brown algorithm and is able to color larger
graphs, and the new heuristic methods, the classical methods, and
the exact method are compared.

A Methodology for Calculating and
Optimizing Real-Time System Performance

The continually increasing size, complexity,
number of types, and cost of data processing systems 
are causing serious re-examination within government
and industry of the criteria for and methods of 
calculating and optimizing data processing system cost
and performance.

The Equivalence of Reducing Transition
Languages and Deterministic Languages

The class of reducing transition languages
introduced by Eickel, Paul, Bauer, and Samelson 
was shown by Morris to be a proper superclass of the
simple precedence languages.
