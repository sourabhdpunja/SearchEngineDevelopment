Intentional Resolution of Privacy Protection in Database Systems

Traditionally, privacy protection in database
systems is understood to be the control over 
what information a given user can get from a database.

Direct control of ordering seems to simplify
correctness arguments and also simplifies implementation in <b>distributed</b>
systems.

The abstract model provides
a framework for implementing flexible schedulers 
in real <b>operating</b> systems.

The origin and 
evolution of the hardware, <b>operating</b> system, and languages
are described in terms of technological change, 
user requirements, and user developments.

Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System

The concept of one event happening before
another in a <b>distributed</b> system is examined, and
is shown to define a partial ordering of the events.

The
bases for this organization are a generalized interrupt structure
and the newly introduced concept of "file tagging," which is the
process of associating program structures and interrupt generating
conditions with items in the data base.

Protection and the Control of Information Sharing in Multics

The design of mechanisms to control the sharing
of information in the Multics system is described.

It also suggested an important
new concept for <b>operating</b> systems: separation 
of the scheduling from the maintenance functions in resource
allocation.

Unfortunately, these systems often 
do not respond to changes in the manner that intuition
would suggest, and there are few guides to assist 
in the analysis of performance characteristics.
