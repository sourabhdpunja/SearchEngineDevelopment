On Computing Sets of Shortest Paths in a Graph

Two algorithms are presented that construct
the k shortest paths between every pair of vertices 
in a directed graph.

Cellular Arrays for the Solution of Graph Problems

A cellular array is a two-dimensional, checkerboard
type interconnection of identical modules 
(or cells), where each cell contains a few bits of
memory and a small amount of combinational logic, 
and communicates mainly with its immediate neighbors
in the array.

Pictorial 
results produced by each of the algorithms are presented
and the relative performances of the algorithms 
are compared.

On the Conversion of Programs to Decision Tables: Method and Objectives

The problems of converting programs to decision
tables are investigated.

In this technique the heuristic 
of the problem is not embedded in the recognition algorithm
but is expressed in a figure of merit.

A
criterion for the implementation efficiency of an 
algorithm is developed and results in the definition
of time-invariant algorithms, which include most 
of the commonly implemented ones.

The properties 
of an edge are embedded in a figure of merit and the edge
detection problem becomes the problem of minimizing 
the given figure of merit.

In the course of the analysis, a substructure
was discovered which has relevance to the 
relative performance of the two algorithms and to their
absolute performance as compared with a standard 
primal-Simplex solution without decomposition.

A Method for Finding Hamilton Paths and Knight's Tours

The use of Warnsdorff's rule for finding a
knight's tour is generalized and applied to the 
problem of finding a Hamilton path in a graph.

The source of this over head is separated into various
levels of protocol hierarchy and the characteristics 
of each level are summarized.
