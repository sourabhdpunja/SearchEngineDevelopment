These models show that
adaptive routing does not satisfy the necessary 
conditions for an optimal routing,  Adaptive routing tends
to overuse the direct path and underuse alternate 
routes because it does not consider the impact of its
current routing decision on the future state of 
the <b>network</b>.

A Correctness Proof of a Topology Information
Main tenance Protocol for a Distributed Computer 
Network

In order for the nodes of a distributed computer
<b>network</b> to communicate, each node must have 
<b>information</b> about the <b>network</b>'s topology.

The algorithm is described as being practical 
 because it is not optimal according to metrics developed
for its analysis in this paper, and also because 
it can be implemented in existing networks with less complexity
than that required for the known alternatives.

The analyzed problem statement 
was translated to the form necessary for use by the
SODA (Systems Optimization and Design Algorithm)
program for the generation of alternative specifications
of program modules and logical database structures.

Examples of applications
of the criteria concern the reading of 
a time-of-day clock,  the synchronization of parallel
processes, protection in multiprogrammed systems, 
and the assignment of capability indexes.

The
bases for this organization are a generalized interrupt structure
and the newly introduced concept of "file tagging," which is the
process of associating program structures and interrupt generating
conditions with items in the data base.
