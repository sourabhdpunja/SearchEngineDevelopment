These <b><b>algorithm</b>s</b> generalize the Floyd
<b>algorithm</b> and the Dantzig <b>algorithm</b> for finding 
the shortest path between every pair of vertices in a directed graph.

In particular, several parallelized 
<b>algorithms</b> are presented for the solution of certain
spanning tree, distance, and path problems, with 
direct applications to wire routing, PERT chart analysis,
and the analysis of many types of networks.

Pictorial 
results produced by each of the <b>algorithms</b> are presented
and the relative performances of the <b>algorithms</b> 
are compared.

Complexity of Computations

The framework for research in the theory of complexity
of computations is described, emphasizing 
the in terrelation between seemingly diverse problems
and methods.

The relation
between the structure of the figure of merit and 
the complexity of the optimization process is then discussed.

Rank:8
In the course of the analysis, a substructure
was discovered which has relevance to the 
relative performance of the two <b>algorithms</b> and to their
absolute performance as compared with a standard 
primal-Simplex solution without decomposition.

<b>Some</b> experimental results 
are given; these show how various information about the
shape of the contour of an object can be embedded
in the figure of merit, thus allowing the extraction
of contours from noisy picture and the separation 
of touching objects.

The source of this over head is separated into various
levels of protocol hierarchy and the characteristics 
of each level are summarized.
