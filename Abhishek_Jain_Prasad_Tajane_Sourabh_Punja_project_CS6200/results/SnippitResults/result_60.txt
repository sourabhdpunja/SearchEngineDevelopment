A Back-<b>end</b> Computer for Data Base Management

It is proposed that the data base <b>management</b>
function be placed on a dedicated <b>back</b>-<b>end</b> computer 
which accepts commands (in a relatively high level language
such as the CODASYL Data Base Task Group, 
April 1971 Report) from a host computer, accesses the
data base on secondary storage, and returns results.

Existing noninferential, formatted data <b>systems</b> 
provide users with tree-structured files or slightly more general <b>network</b>

Prime design goals of the design are the
ability to produce highly efficient object code, 
to allow access to all relevant <b>hardware</b> features of
the host machine, and to provide a rational means 
by which to cope with the evolutionary nature of <b>systems</b>
programs.

Among
these are the need for a notation for iterating 
over the elements of any finite set (instead of the
more narrow for i:= 1 to n notation), the use of 
the domain of an array as a data type, the need for
a simple notation for allowing types of parameters 
to be themselves parameters (but in a restrictive fashion),
and resulting problems with conversion of 
values from one type to another.

explicit criteria for accepting or rejecting 
proposed system features.
