Use of the Concept of Transparency in the
Design of Hierarchically Structured Systems

This paper deals with the design of hierarchically
structured programming systems.

A major challenge
in the effective use of cellular arrays for the 
solution of graph problems is the determination of algorithms
that exploit the possibilities for parallelism, 
especially for problems whose solutions appear to be inherently
serial.

The specific topics addressed are: module structure 
and its use in defining abstractions, <b>data</b>-structuring
facilities in Mesa, an equivalence algorithm for 
<b><b>type</b>s</b> and <b>type</b> coercions, the benefits of the <b>type</b> <b>system</b>
and why it is breached occasionally, and the 
difficulty of making the treatment of variant records safe.

Complexity of Computations

The framework for research in the theory of complexity
of computations is described, emphasizing 
the in terrelation between seemingly diverse problems
and methods.

The relation
between the structure of the figure of merit and 
the complexity of the optimization process is then discussed.

A
criterion for the implementation efficiency of an 
algorithm is developed and results in the definition
of time-invariant algorithms, which include most 
of the commonly implemented ones.

A Method for Finding Hamilton Paths and Knight's Tours

The use of Warnsdorff's rule for finding a
knight's tour is generalized and applied to the 
problem of finding a Hamilton path in a graph.

A Study of Line Overhead in the Arpanet

The form, extent, and effect of the communication line
overhead in the ARPANET are considered.

In the course of the analysis, a substructure
was discovered which has relevance to the 
relative performance of the two algorithms and to their
absolute performance as compared with a standard 
primal-Simplex solution without decomposition.

If w denotes the word length of the machine
employed, the storage (in machine words) required 
for a graph with n nodes and m edges increases essentially
as 2(m+n) in case (i), or (n^2)/win case 
(ii).
