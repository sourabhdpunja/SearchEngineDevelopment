It is shown that 
different <b>algorithms</b> suggested in the literature vary significantly
in execution time and that the B-schedule 
of Coffman and Graham is near-optimal.

The Nucleus of a Multiprogramming System

This paper describes the philosophy and structure of a multiprogramming system 
that can be extended with a hierarchy of operating systems to suit diverse 
requirements of program scheduling and resource allocation.

The analyzed problem statement 
was translated to the form necessary for use by the
SODA (Systems Optimization and Design Algorithm)
program for the generation of alternative specifications
of program modules and logical database <b>structures</b>.

The
bases for this organization are a generalized interrupt structure
and the newly introduced concept of "file tagging," which is the
process of associating program <b>structures</b> and interrupt generating
conditions with items in the data base.

Each subsystem is chosen from large
numbers of alternatives; the selection is based 
on considerations such as system response time, system
cost, and the distribution of data storage and 
processing between the graphics processor and its supporting
data processing system.
