Analysis of the Availability of Computer
Systems Using Computer- Aided Algebra

Analytical results, related to the availability
of a computer system constructed of unreliable 
processors, are presented in this paper.

This paper proposes a simple general method 
of high-level data flow analysis that allows free use
of escape and jump statements, avoids large graphs 
when compiling large programs, facilitates updating of
data flow information to reflect program changes, 
and derives new global information helpful in solving
many familiar global flow analysis problems.

One-Pass Compilation of Arithmetic Expressions for a Parallel Processor

Under the assumption that a processor may have
a multiplicity of arithmetic units, a compiler 
for such a processor should produce object code to take
advantage of possible parallelism of operation.

to the telephone terminals, but the system 
will normally be used in conjunction with remotely located
high speed printing devices.
