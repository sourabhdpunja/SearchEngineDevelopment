The Nucleus of a Multiprogramming System

This paper describes the philosophy and structure of a multiprogramming system 
that can be extended with a hierarchy of operating systems to suit diverse 
requirements of program scheduling and resource allocation.

On the Interface Between Computers and Data Communications Systems

Future systems that combine computers, digital
terminals, and communications equipment present 
design optimization problems that require reconsideration
of the traditional functional responsibilities 
of the respective subsystems.

Interarrival Statistics for Time Sharing Systems

The optimization of time-shared system performance
requires the description of the stochastic 
processes governing the user inputs and the program activity.

A Comparison of List Schedules for Parallel Processing Systems

The problem of scheduling two or more processors
to minimize the execution time of a program 
which consists of a set of partially ordered tasks
is studied.

The system was
produced to test the effect of <b>machine</b> architecture 
on complexity of software.

The
bases for this organization are a generalized interrupt structure
and the newly introduced concept of "file tagging," which is the
process of associating program structures and interrupt generating
conditions with items in the data base.

A Methodology for Calculating and
Optimizing Real-Time System Performance

The continually increasing size, complexity,
number of types, and cost of data processing systems 
are causing serious re-examination within government
and industry of the criteria for and methods of 
calculating and optimizing data processing system cost
and performance.
