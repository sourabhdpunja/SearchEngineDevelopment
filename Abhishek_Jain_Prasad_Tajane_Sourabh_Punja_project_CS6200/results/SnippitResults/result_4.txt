A System for Interprocess Communication
in a Resource Sharing Computer Network

A system of communication between processes in a
time-sharing system is described and the communication 
system is extended so that it may be used between processes
<b>distributed</b> throughout a computer network.

The relationship of the mechanism
to protection <b>mechanisms</b> in the system is explained; in particular,
eventcounts are shown to be applicable to situations where confinement
of information matters.

A model of protection <b>mechanisms</b> in computing
systems is presented and its appropriateness 
is argued.

These include ways of augmenting written
natural language by various notational and linguistic 
devices, the exhibition of the structure inherent in the
information we are <b>communicating</b>, and a sophisticated 
interactive system controlled by computer.

Described in this paper are a number
of techniques that have been used to build a LISP 
system utilizing a drum for its principal storage medium,
 with a surprisingly low time penalty for use 
of this slow storage device.

When each process specifies its 
future needs by a flowchart of need-defined steps, a global
approach to the phenomenon and its in terpretation 
as a game between the operating system and the processes
allows formalization of risk and safety concepts.
