For example, how to compute
operator precedence or Wirth-Weber precedence 
relations in O(n^2) steps is shown, as well as how to
compute linear precedence functions in O(n^2) steps 
is shown, as well as how to compute linear precedence
functions in O(n) steps, where n is the size of 
a grammer.

Three Criteria for Designing Computing Systems to Facilitate Debugging

The designer of a computing system should adopt
explicit criteria for accepting or rejecting 
proposed system features.

The method described is suitable for parallel 
processing because the operations relative to each
state can be computed in parallel, and the number
of stages is equal to the length N of the curves (or
to log2 N if the approximate method is used).

DPL, a programming language and supervisory
system in which these concepts are implemented, is used to illustrated
the new organization which is proposed for management information systems.

When specifying these interfaces, 
consideration must be given to problems of coordination,
synchronization, error control, signaling, stream 
multiplexing, and switch control, in addition to minimizing
the technological interdependence of specific 
subsystem designs.

The input process 
is assumed to be stationary, and to be defined by the
interarrival time distribution.
