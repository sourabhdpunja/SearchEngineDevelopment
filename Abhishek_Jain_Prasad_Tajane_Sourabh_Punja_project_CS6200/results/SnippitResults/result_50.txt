These algorithms exhibit a computation time that in
many cases grows at a rate not exceeding log2 n, 
where n is the number of nodes in the graph.

It is concluded that the algorithm operating in
conjunction with the hexagonal array has features 
which strike a balance between those of the other two arrays.

On Computing Sets of Shortest Paths in a Graph

Two algorithms are presented that construct
the k shortest paths between every pair of vertices 
in a directed graph.

Some Ideas on Data Types in High-Level Languages

A number of issues are explored concerning the
notion that a data type is a set of values together 
with a set of primitive operations on those values.

This is part of an ambitious
program of development in advanced programming languages, and relations
with other aspects of the project are also discussed.

This language
is designed so as to be especially suitable 
for use in writing production software systems for a
specific machine (the PDP-10): compilers, operating 
systems, etc.

Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System

The concept of one event happening before
another in a distributed system is examined, and
is shown to define a partial ordering of the events.

Complexity of Computations

The framework for research in the theory of complexity
of computations is described, emphasizing 
the in terrelation between seemingly diverse problems
and methods.
