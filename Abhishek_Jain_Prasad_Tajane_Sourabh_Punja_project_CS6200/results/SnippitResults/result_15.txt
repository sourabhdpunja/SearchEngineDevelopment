The Conversion of Limited-Entry Decision Tables
to Optimal and Near-Optimal Flowcharts: Two New 
Algorithms

Two new algorithms for deriving optimal and
near-optimal flowcharts from limited entry decision 
tables are presented.

The Nucleus of a Multiprogramming System

This paper describes the philosophy and structure of a multiprogramming system 
that can be extended with a hierarchy of operating systems to suit diverse 
requirements of program scheduling and resource allocation.

On the Interface Between Computers and Data Communications Systems

Future systems that combine computers, digital
terminals, and communications equipment present 
design <b><b>optimization</b></b> problems that require reconsideration
of the traditional functional responsibilities 
of the respective subsystems.

Examples of applications
of the criteria concern the reading of 
a time-of-day clock,  the synchronization of parallel
processes, protection in multiprogrammed systems, 
and the assignment of capability indexes.

Peephole Optimization

Redundant instructions may be discarded during
the final stage of compilation by using a simple 
optimizing technique called peephole <b><b>optimization</b></b>.

The
bases for this organization are a generalized interrupt structure
and the newly introduced concept of "file tagging," which is the
process of associating program structures and interrupt generating
conditions with items in the data base.

Object code Optimization

Methods of analyzing the control flow and data
flow of programs during compilation are applied 
to transforming the program to improve object time efficiency.

The parameters of the model are functions
of the capabilities of the graphics hardware 
and of the computational requirements of the graphics application.

The relation
between the structure of the figure of merit and 
the complexity of the <b><b>optimization</b></b> process is then discussed.
