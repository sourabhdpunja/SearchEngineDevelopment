Hierarchical Geometric Models for Visible Surface Algorithms

The geometric structure inherent in the definition
of the shapes of three-dimensional objects 
and environments is used not just to define their relative
motion and placement, but also to assist in 
solving many other problems of systems for producing
pictures by <b>computer</b>.

The Nucleus of a Multiprogramming System

<b>This</b> paper describes the philosophy and structure of a multiprogramming system 
that can be extended with a hierarchy of operating systems to suit diverse 
requirements of program scheduling and resource allocation.

Each quadric surface intersection curve (QSIC) 
is represented as a set of coefficients and parameter
limits.

A
criterion for the implementation efficiency of an 
algorithm is developed and results in the definition
of time-invariant <b>algorithms</b>, which include most 
of the commonly implemented ones.

Human visual
perception and the fundamental laws of optics are 
considered in the development of a shading rule that
provides better quality and increased realism in 
generated images.

DPL, a programming language and supervisory
system in which these concepts are implemented, is used to illustrated
the new organization which is proposed for management information systems.

Rank:10
Criteria for evaluating 
performance are described; a methodology for calculating
and optimizing is outlined; and the method is 
illustrated by carrying out a portion of the performance
calculation and the optimization of a drum-oriented 
message switching system.
