In particular, several parallelized 
algorithms are presented for the solution of certain
spanning tree, distance, and path problems, with 
direct applications to wire routing, PERT chart analysis,
and the analysis of many types of networks.

Among
these are the need for a notation for iterating 
over the elements of any finite set (instead of the
more narrow for i:= 1 to n notation), the use of 
the domain of an array as a data type, the need for
a simple notation for allowing types of parameters 
to be themselves parameters (but in a restrictive fashion),
and resulting problems with conversion of 
values from one type to another.

Pictorial 
results produced by each of the algorithms are presented
and the relative performances of the algorithms 
are compared.

Based on primitive notions of module, message,
and transaction key, the methodology is shown to be independent
of particular languages and machines.

A variety 
of data representations which have been used to describe
structured information are then examined, and 
the characteristics of various processing languages are
outlined in the light of the procedures requiring 
implementation.

This paper attempts to isolate 
the notion of type checking and presents a partial
solution to the type checking problem based on the 
notions of abstraction and application of functions.

Extensions to the <b>theory</b> of computation 
and computability are suggested.

A major feature which contributes 
to the realization of these goals is a mechanism permitting
the definition of the representation of all 
data structures in terms of the access algorithm for elements of the structure.

The <b>theory</b> is applied to the 
proof of several elementary theorems concerning the semantics
of the assignment, conditional, and iterative 
statements.

These algorithms generalize the Floyd
algorithm and the Dantzig algorithm for finding 
the shortest path between every pair of vertices in a directed graph.
