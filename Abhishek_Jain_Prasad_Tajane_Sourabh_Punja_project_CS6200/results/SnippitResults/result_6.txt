The principal features 
of the system are: (1) the surfaces are rendered as isoparametric
line drawings on a head-mounted display, 
and they are designed with the aid of a three-dimensional
"wand," which allows 3-D movements of the points 
controlling the shapes of the surfaces, (2) all of the
interactions with the surfaces are in real-time, 
and (3) the mathematical formulations used assume no
knowledge of them by the user of the system.

Representations for Space Planning

Problems involving the arrangement of objects in two- 
or three-space where the objective function primarily consists
of derivatives of the distance between objects or their arrangement
are called space <b>planning</b> problems.

Distinctive 
features of the design were the use of capabilities
for protection, and the organization of the system 
into a sequence of layers, each building on the facilities
provided by earlier ones and protecting itself 
from the malfunctions of later ones.
