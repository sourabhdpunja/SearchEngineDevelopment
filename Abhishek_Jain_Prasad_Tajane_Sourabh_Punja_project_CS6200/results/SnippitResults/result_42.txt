In particular, several parallelized 
algorithms are presented for the solution of certain
spanning tree, distance, and path problems, with 
direct applications to wire routing, PERT chart analysis,
and the analysis of many types of networks.

Thinning Algorithms on Rectangular, Hexagonal, and Triangular Arrays

In this report three thinning algorithms are
developed: one each for use with rectangular, 
hexagonal, and triangular arrays.

Prime design goals of the design are the
ability to produce highly efficient object code, 
to allow access to all relevant hardware features of
the host machine, and to provide a rational means 
by which to cope with the evolutionary nature of systems
programs.

Based on primitive notions of module, message,
and transaction key, the methodology is shown to be independent
of particular languages and machines.

Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System

The concept of one event happening before
another in a distributed system is examined, and
is shown to define a partial ordering of the events.

Abstraction and Verification in Alphard: Defining
and Specifying Iteration and Generators

The Alphard "form" provides the programmer with
a great deal of control over the implementation 
of abstract data types.
