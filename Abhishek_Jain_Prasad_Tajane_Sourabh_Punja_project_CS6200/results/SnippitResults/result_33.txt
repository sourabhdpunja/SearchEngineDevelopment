These algorithms generalize the Floyd
algorithm and the Dantzig algorithm for finding 
the shortest path between every pair of vertices in a directed graph.

A major challenge
in the effective use of cellular arrays for the 
solution of graph problems is the determination of algorithms
that exploit the possibilities for parallelism, 
<b>especially</b> for problems whose solutions appear to be inherently
serial.

Perturbations of Eigenvalues of Non-normal Matrices

The problem considered is to give <b>bounds</b> for finite
perturbations of simple and multiple eigenvalues 
of nonnormal matrices, where these <b>bounds</b> are in terms
of the eigenvalues, the departure from normality, 
and the Frobenius norm of the perturbation matrix, but
not in terms of the eigen system.

The problems of converting programs to decision
tables are investigated.

Pictorial 
results produced by each of the algorithms are presented
and the relative performances of the algorithms 
are compared.

A
criterion for the implementation efficiency of an 
algorithm is developed and results in the definition
of time-<b>invariant</b> algorithms, which include most 
of the commonly implemented ones.

Some experimental results 
are given; these show how various information about the
shape of the contour of an object can be embedded
in the figure of merit, thus allowing the extraction
of contours from noisy picture and the <b>separation</b> 
of touching objects.

In the course of the analysis, a substructure
was discovered which has relevance to the 
relative performance of the two algorithms and to their
absolute performance as compared with a standard 
primal-Simplex solution without <b>decomposition</b>.

A Method for Finding Hamilton Paths and Knight's Tours

The use of Warnsdorff's rule for finding a
knight's tour is generalized and applied to the 
problem of finding a Hamilton path in a graph.
