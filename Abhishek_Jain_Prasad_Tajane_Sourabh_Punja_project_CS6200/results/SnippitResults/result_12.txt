The Nucleus of a Multiprogramming System

This paper describes the philosophy and structure of a multiprogramming system 
that can be extended with a hierarchy of <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> to suit diverse 
requirements of program scheduling and resource allocation.

The Multics Virtual Memory: Concepts and Design

As experience with use of on-line <b>operating</b>
<b>systems</b> has grown, the need to share information 
among system users has become increasingly apparent.

Rank:5
The 
microprogram defines a machine with some unusual architectural
feature; the software exploits these features 
to define the <b>operating</b> system as simply as possible.

The PDP-10's
contributions to computing technology include: 
accelerating the transition from batch oriented to time
sharing computing <b>systems</b>; transferring hardware 
technology within DEC (and elsewhere) to minicomputer
design and manufacturing; supporting minicomputer 
hardware and software development; and serving as a
model for single user and timeshared interactive 
minicomputer/microcomputer <b>systems</b>.

The continued 
use of such a structure raises questions about its effects
on the usefulness of future <b>systems</b>, particularly 
with regard to such trends as time sharing, parallel
programming, and, eventually, <b>systems</b> which learn.

The abstract model provides
a framework for implementing flexible schedulers 
in real <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b>.

Exclusive Simulation of Activity in Digital Networks

A technique for simulating the detailed logic
networks of large and active digital <b>systems</b> 
is described.

Direct control of ordering seems to simplify
correctness arguments and also simplifies implementation in distributed
<b>systems</b>.
