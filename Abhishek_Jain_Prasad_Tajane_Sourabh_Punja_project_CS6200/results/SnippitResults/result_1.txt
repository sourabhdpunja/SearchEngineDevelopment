Interarrival Statistics for Time <b>Sharing</b> Systems

The optimization of time-shared <b>system</b> performance
requires the description of the stochastic 
processes governing the user inputs and the program activity.

An Experimental Comparison of Time <b>Sharing</b> and Batch Processing

The effectiveness for program development
of the MIT Compatible Time-<b>Sharing</b> System (CTSS) 
was compared with that of the <b>IBM</b> IBSYS batch-processing
<b>system</b> by means of a statistically designed 
experiment.

Some Criteria for Time-<b>Sharing</b> System Performance

Time-sharing <b>system</b>s, as defined in this article,
are those multiaccess <b>system</b>s which permit 
a terminal user to utilize essentially the full resources
of the <b>system</b> while sharing its time with other 
terminal users.
