On the Relative Efficiencies of Context-Free Grammar Recognizers

A number of diverse <b>recognition</b> procedures
that have been proposed for <b>parsing</b> sentences with 
respect to a <b>context-free</b> grammar are described in this
paper by means of a common device.

A major challenge
in the effective use of cellular arrays for the 
solution of graph problems is the determination of algorithms
that exploit the possibilities for parallelism, 
especially for problems whose solutions appear to be inherently
serial.

A Boolean Matrix Method for the Computation
of Linear Precedence Functions

A modified version of Bell's Boolean matrix
method for the computation of linear precedence 
functions associated with a conflict-free matrix of
precedence relations is given.

In this technique the heuristic 
of the problem is not embedded in the <b>recognition</b> <b>algorithm</b>
but is expressed in a figure of merit.

A
criterion for the implementation efficiency of an 
<b>algorithm</b> is developed and results in the definition
of time-invariant <b>algorithm</b>s, which include most 
of the commonly implemented ones.
