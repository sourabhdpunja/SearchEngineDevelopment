The Nucleus of a Multiprogramming System

This paper describes the philosophy and structure of a multiprogramming system 
that can be extended with a hierarchy of <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> to suit diverse 
requirements of program scheduling and resource allocation.

An example of such 
a data base is a hierarchy of directories for an on-line
file system.

Examples of applications
of the criteria concern the reading of 
a time-of-day clock,  the synchronization of parallel
<b>processes</b>, protection in multiprogrammed <b>systems</b>, 
and the assignment of capability indexes.

Here, the design and implementation 
considerations of segmentation and sharing in Multics
are first discussed under the assumption that all 
information resides in large, segmented main memory.

Interarrival Statistics for Time Sharing Systems

The optimization of time-shared system performance
requires the description of the stochastic 
<b>processes</b> governing the user inputs and the program activity.

It is shown that 
different algorithms suggested in the literature vary significantly
in execution time and that the B-schedule 
of Coffman and Graham is near-optimal.
