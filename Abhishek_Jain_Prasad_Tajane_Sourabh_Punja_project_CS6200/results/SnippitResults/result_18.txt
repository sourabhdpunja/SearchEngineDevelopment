Program Structures for Parallel Processing

Constructs for organizing and explicating <b>parallel</b>
program segments are discussed as extensions 
to ALGOL 60.

These serve partly as brackets in establishing
a range of <b>parallel</b> operation and partly to 
define each <b>parallel</b> path within this range.

It is shown that 
different algorithms suggested in the literature vary significantly
in execution time and that the B-schedule 
of Coffman and Graham is near-optimal.

Three Criteria for Designing Computing Systems to Facilitate Debugging

The designer of a computing system should adopt
explicit criteria for accepting or rejecting 
proposed system features.

An Interrupt Based Organization for Management Information Systems

A programming structure, language constructs, and a supervisory system 
organization are proposed
for the design and coding of large shared data base systems.

On the Interface Between Computers and Data Communications Systems

Future systems that combine computers, digital
terminals, and communications equipment present 
design optimization problems that require reconsideration
of the traditional functional responsibilities 
of the respective subsystems.

Timing estimates and an indication
of compiler requirements are also given.

A Methodology for Calculating and
Optimizing Real-Time System Performance

The continually increasing size, complexity,
number of types, and cost of data processing systems 
are causing serious re-examination within government
and industry of the criteria for and methods of 
calculating and optimizing data processing system cost
and performance.

Rank:10
Practical application to the 
design of <b>compilers</b> for such computers is discussed.
