and asynchronous reproducibility of output.

A popular way of 
accomplishing this is to encode the software in a specially
designed machine-independent language and 
then to map this language, often using a macro processor,
into the assembly language of each desired 
object machine.

A Class of Unambiguous Computer <b>Languages</b>

Discussed in this paper is the concept of
a fully nested computer language which may be one 
means of designing computer languages which would be completely
free of ambiguities.

The main results obtained 
are a clear and useful separation of structural and behavioral
model description, a reduction of manual 
tasks in converting Boolean logic into a structural model,
the elimination of manual processes in achieving 
exclusive simulation of activity, an event-scheduling
technique which does not deteriorate in economy
as the event queue grows in length, and a simulation
procedure which deals effectively with any mixture 
of serial and simultaneous activities.
